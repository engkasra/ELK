# ELK Setting 

# Xms and Xmx 

In Elasticsearch, the parameters -Xms2g and -Xmx2g are used to specify the minimum and maximum heap memory allocation for the Elasticsearch Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Here's what each parameter means:

-Xms2g: This parameter sets the initial heap size for the JVM. In this case, 2g means 2 gigabytes of memory. It defines the amount of memory allocated when the Elasticsearch process starts.

-Xmx2g: This parameter sets the maximum heap size for the JVM. Again, 2g indicates 2 gigabytes of memory. It defines the upper limit of memory that Elasticsearch can utilize.

By setting both -Xms and -Xmx to the same value (in this case, 2g), you are specifying a fixed heap size for Elasticsearch. This can be useful when you want to limit the memory usage of Elasticsearch or if you have a specific requirement for memory allocation.

However, it's worth noting that these values are just examples. The actual values you choose for -Xms and -Xmx should depend on the available system resources and the requirements of your Elasticsearch cluster. It's generally recommended to allocate an appropriate amount of memory based on your data size, query load, and other factors to ensure optimal performance.

# bootstrap.memory_lock

The bootstrap.memory_lock setting in Elasticsearch is a configuration option that determines whether Elasticsearch's memory should be locked in physical memory (RAM) or not.

When bootstrap.memory_lock is set to true, it means that Elasticsearch will attempt to lock its memory in RAM. This is often done to prevent the operating system from swapping the Elasticsearch process's memory to disk. Swapping memory to disk can result in performance degradation because disk access is significantly slower compared to RAM.

By locking the memory, Elasticsearch aims to ensure that its heap memory remains in RAM at all times, providing better performance and predictable response times. However, this setting requires Elasticsearch to have sufficient privileges to lock memory, and it may not be supported on all platforms or operating systems.

It's worth noting that configuring bootstrap.memory_lock requires specific operating system-level configurations and permissions. Therefore, it's recommended to consult the Elasticsearch documentation and your operating system's documentation for detailed instructions and considerations before enabling this option.

When xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled is set to true, it means that SSL/TLS encryption is enabled for the transport layer communication between nodes in the Elasticsearch cluster. This ensures that the data transmitted between nodes is encrypted and secure, protecting it from unauthorized access or interception.

Enabling SSL/TLS encryption for transport communication is an important security measure, especially in production environments or when sensitive data is being transmitted across the cluster. It helps prevent potential eavesdropping or tampering with the data while it is in transit.

To configure SSL/TLS encryption for transport communication, you will need to generate or obtain SSL/TLS certificates and configure the necessary settings for key and trust stores. The specific steps for configuring SSL/TLS encryption in Elasticsearch can vary depending on your environment and requirements.

Please note that the X-Pack Security plugin is now included as a free feature in the default distribution of Elasticsearch starting from version 6.8.
